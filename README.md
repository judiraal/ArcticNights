# Arctic Nights

This is a NeoForge mod that adds variable day/night length based on latitude (z-coordinate) and positions the sun 
accordingly. Optionally adjusts the worldgen temperature so biome generation follows along. 

Integrates with [Serene Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serene-seasons) to maximize the effects in 
winter. Combines well with [Cold Sweat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cold-sweat) to get a realistic feel
for the environment.
